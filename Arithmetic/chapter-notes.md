# How to Design Programs (HtDP) - Chapter 1 Notes

## 1.1 The Arithmetic of Numbers

### Basic Arithmetic Operations
- Racket (the programming language used in HtDP) supports standard arithmetic operations:
  - `+` for addition
  - `-` for subtraction
  - `*` for multiplication
  - `/` for division

### Examples:
```racket
(+ 3 4)        ; 3 + 4 = 7
(- 10 5)       ; 10 - 5 = 5
(* 2 3)        ; 2 ร 3 = 6
(/ 12 4)       ; 12 รท 4 = 3
```
